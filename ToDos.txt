===========Known Issues============
- Should move pathfinding to server to fix the following issues
    - Enemies stop when their target disconnects and do not find another target.
    - Enemies may appear jittery to players other than their target.

- Need to fix security issue: remove semi-sensitive data from cookie and properly decrypt it from the session cookie.
- Rejoining/refreshing the game page can cause errors populating players.
- Wrong player may disappear when a networked player dies.

==============Plans================
- Move all pathing to server. May have to use CSV for map layers instead of JSON but should otherwise be straightforward with some refactoring.
- Add ability to move to a different floor. Can be done using multiple scenes in Phaser. Will require
- Switch from static map to server-generated modular map (https://github.com/mikewesthad/dungeon)
- Add feedback for getting hit/death and hitting enemies
- Add methods to Enemy class (e.g. enemy.hurt(damage)) for simpler management and improved modularity.
- Create a Player class to faciliate features such as leveling and item usage
- Chance to drop item on enemy death
- Save a player's state (stats, position, etc.) if they leave and resume them in that state on rejoin.
